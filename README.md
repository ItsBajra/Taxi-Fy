> [!NOTE]
> My first project using Python.<br/>
> Used customtkinter for the GUI, tkintermapview for the Map Integration API, geopy module for calculating distance and many more.<br/>
> Clients can easily create an account. Drivers requires verification from admin after registration. Admin login details is provided in the 'IMPORTANT NOTE.txt'.<br/>
> The application is basically a taxi booking application like Uber which includes choosing pickup and drop location from the map feature for clients. Upon sending the booking request, the admin must verify and assign a driver to that booking. And, after the driver is assigned and booking is confirmed, the assigned driver's GUI will show their next ride details (SS can be found below). The application consists of CRUD operation features for all the users.
